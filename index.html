<li><b> My goal is to become a really good frontend developer.</b><p>I want to change 
   my profession because of two things. The first one is my current job. I 
   think i do my best as an estimate engineer. Also I have already optimized 
   the work of our estimate department enough to make it fast and comfort. So 
   I don`t have any strong arguments to continue working as an estimate engineer. 
   And the second reason is that I am sure that i can be a good fronted developer. 
   I have some points which are necessary for a good developer. I wish I will 
   be a good Junior for a start. Also I have some ideas to make my own projects 
   in case of job search will take more time that I expect.</p></li>
<li><b>The set of my skills.</b><p>I am just a begginer, but every day I study 
   hard to become better as a developer. I study <b>HTML & CSS & JS</b>. I already
   know <b>Git</b>, can use <b>Figma</b> and <b>IDE</b> (VS Code). I partly know an object-oriented
   programming model. Also I improve my knowledge of an algorithms. Every day
   I do different tasks at codewars etc. Beside that I have some manual
   testing skills and have some theory knowledge about manual testing, 
   but I have been never worked in software testing.</p></li>
<li><b>Here is some of my solutions in the codewars: </b>
   <b>Is input line a palindrome?</b>
   <pre><code><i>function isPalindrome(line)
    line = String(line);
    let i;
 
    for (i = 0; i &lt; line.length / 2 ; i++)
    return line[i] == 
 
    line[line.length - i - 1];</i></code></pre>
   <b>Remove First and Last Character</b>
   <pre><i><code>function removeChar(str){
    let i ;
    let newStr = '';

    for (i = 1; i &lt; str.length - 1; i++){
    newStr = `${newStr}${str[i]}`;
    };

    return newStr;
    };</code></i></pre>
   <b>Reversed Strings</b>
   <pre><i><code>function solution(str){
    let i;
    let result = '';

    for (i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    result = `${result}${str[i]}`
    };

    return result;_br>
    }</code></i></pre>
<li><p>I am studying frontend develope at the <b>Rolling Scopes School</b>. Already learn: 
   <i>HTML & CSS & JS - basics level, Git, Figma</i>. I have <i>done some theory tests</i> and 
   <i>made some coding tasks</i>.</p></li>
 <li><p>RS School Some lessons of CS50 Railway engineering (higher education) Estimate 
    engineering (additional higher education).</p></li>
 <li><p>My <b>english level</b> is about <b>A2~B1</b> according to language tests. This CV i have done 
    by myself. I think this is the best indicator of my real english skills.</p></li>
