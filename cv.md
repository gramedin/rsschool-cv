3 **My goal is to become a really good frontend developer.**
I want to change my profession because of two things. The first one is my current job. I think i do my best as an estimate engineer. Also I have already optimized the work of our estimate department enough to make it fast and comfort. So I don`t have any strong arguments to continue working as an estimate engineer. And the second reason is that I am sure that i can be a good fronted developer. I have some points which are necessary for a good developer. I wish I will be a good Junior for a start.
Also I have some ideas to make my own projects in case of job search will take more time that I expect.

4 **The set of my skills.**
I am just a begginer, but every day I study hard to become better as a developer. I study **HTML & CSS & JS**. I already know **Git**, can use **Figma** and **IDE** (VS Code). I partly know an **object-oriented programming model**. Also I improve my knowledge of an **algorithms**. Every day I do different **tasks at codewars** etc. Beside that I have **some manual testing skills and** have some **theory** knowledge about manual testing, but I have been never worked in software testing.


5 **Here is some of my solutions** in the [codewars](codewars.com):
***Is input line a palindrome?**

_function isPalindrome(line) {_
_line = String(line);_
_let i;_
_for (i = 0; i < line.length / 2 ; i++)_
_return line[i] == line[line.length - i - 1];_
_};_

***Remove First and Last Character**

_function removeChar(str){_
  _let i ;_
  _let newStr = '';_
  _for (i = 1; i < str.length - 1; i++) {_
    _newStr = `${newStr}${str[i]}`;_
  _};_
  _return newStr;_
_};_

**Reversed Strings**

_function solution(str){_
 _ let i;_
 _ let result = '';_
      _  for (i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {_
        _  result = `${result}${str[i]}`_
         _  };_
      _return result;_
_}_


6 I am studying frontend develope at the **Rolling Scopes School**. Already learn: *HTML & CSS & JS - basics level, Git, Figma*. I have *done some theory tests* and *made some coding tasks*.

7 RS School
  Some lessons of CS50 
_Railway engineering (higher education)_
_Estimate engineering (additional higher education)._ 

8 My **english level** is about **A2~B1** according to language tests. This CV i have done by myself. I think this is the best indicator of my real english skills.
